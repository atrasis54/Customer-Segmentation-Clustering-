# Customer Segmentation (Clustering)

## Overview
This project applies K-Means clustering and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to segment customers for an e-commerce store. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behavior.

## Objectives:
- Use clustering algorithms to segment customers based on their behavior.
- Apply K-Means and PCA to reduce dimensionality and identify segments.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- K-Means Clustering
- PCA
- Pandas

## Key Insights
- Achieved a silhouette score of 0.72 for customer segmentation.
- Applied dimensionality reduction using PCA for improved clustering performance.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to perform customer segmentation and visualize the results.
